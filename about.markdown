My name is David Vollbracht. I am a father, software developer, and tabletop gamer.
This data art thing is relatively new, but I feel like it's going to stick.

If you want to get in touch with me, please use
<a href="http://twitter.com/qxjit">@qxjit</a> on Twitter.

If you're looking for any of me old blog posts, please be patient. I plan to recover
them from my previous blog setup, which which stopped unexpectedly. I will
republish them with the original urls as soon as I am able. Thank you!
