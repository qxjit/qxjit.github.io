<p class="explanation">

  This was created from around 8,800 data points collected from my personal
time tracking system over the last 2 years. Each circle shows an amount of time
ranging from minutes hours. The coloring indicates how engaging the time was to
my mind (blue), body (green), and soul (red). The flow of time leads from one
circle to the next, with smaller circles turning more sharply and larger
circles jumping further and turning less. If you click, a much larger version
is available where the smaller circles are more easily distinguished.
